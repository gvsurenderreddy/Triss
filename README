TRISS (The Revolution In Search Systems)
In-memory search system for persistent data with SQL-like queries

(Triss is also the first name of brown-haired sorceress from Sapkowski's novels)


MILESTONES (please note, that given milestones order is not final and is likely to change in near future)
----------
* write and benchmark two prototypes (in progress)
    - Alice is the solution, where hash map is used to intersect set of ids. Dev: MichaÅ‚ Rychlik
    - Bob is the solution, where internal db structure contains cross-column pointers. Dev: Przemek Pastuszka (rtshadow)
    - script for generating test data and benchmark framework. Dev: Piotr Olchawa (2easy)
* adapt chosen prototype to alpha version
    See "Adapt chosen prototype to alpha version" in Issues tab for more details
* add SQL interface
* add capability to query TRISS through network
* create documentation; create installer with .deb and .rpm packages

(deadline: June 2012)

* add OR operator
* bindings to languages other than C++ (python has highest priority)
* ORDER BY clause; MERGE operation

Other things (to be completed in unforeseeable future):
* website
* replication / sharding
* INSERT / DELETE / UPDATE


External libraries
------------------
google sparsehash >= 2.0 (as hash map for Alice)
google test >= 1.6 (for unit tests)
scons >= 2.1 (build tool)


How do I build it?
-------------------
In main repository directory use:
    scons [target]
where [target] is one of: bob_test, alice_test, common_test, benchmark
Without [target] specified, you'll build all above targets

Executables will be placed under build/ directory


How do I use it?
-----------------
TRISS is in pre-alpha phase at the moment and is not yet usable. Nevertheless, you may want to see and learn
our prototype API ( https://github.com/rtshadow/Triss/wiki/Prototype-API ), so you'll be ready to immediately harness
whole power of TRISS, when it's done. (this API is also going to change a little bit over time, but not that much).


Current state of work (8.03.2012)
----------------------------------
- script for generating sample data is done (source: tests/helpers/bid_req_generator)
- Bob prototype is done in 70% (source: prototypes/bob)
    we're planning to finish it within a week
- Alice is also going to be here soon (and the source dir will be: prototypes/alice)
- work on benchmark framework is in progress (source: prototypes/benchmark)

Please note, that all file paths given above may change (see "Clean the repository" issue for more details)
